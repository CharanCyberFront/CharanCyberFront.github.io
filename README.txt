MyPortfolio by Sri Charan Gurramkonda

Hello, welcome to my portfolio!

Here, you get to better know me, Charan—who I am and what my passions are. I built this 
site using HTML and CSS, inspired by HTML5 UP's template, Massively. This is the first public 
site I’ve ever created, and I hope you enjoy it. As a security engineer, web development isn't 
my main forte, so go easy on me, haha! That said, feel free to use this template for your own projects!
